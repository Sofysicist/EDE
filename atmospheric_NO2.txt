There's no Jupyter notebook calculation for the atmospheric technosignature (NO2) calculation,
because it was just done in Planetary Spectrum Generator by Ravi. In his simulation, he found that 
SNR = 3.5 for d = 5pc and t = 1200h.  So, with known scalings:

SNR = 3.5 (5 pc / d) sqrt( T / 1200h)

For SNR = 5 and T= 900h...

d = 3pc

The original question is:

At what distance would a 6m LUVEx-style mission be able to detect a cloud-free Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star with 113 ppb concentration of NO2 (ichnoscale=1) with 900 hours of observing time, to an SNR of 5, based on the features from 0.2-0.7 um?

113 ppb concentration = the average NO2 concentration over the US in 1980 (2-3X higher than today)
900 hours observing time = the CANDELS survey, longest single astronomical survey on Hubble
0.2-0.7 um = features observable by LUVEx
